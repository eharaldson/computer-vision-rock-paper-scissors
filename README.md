# Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors

## Milestone 1
- Git is a VCS (Version Control System) which can utilised distributed version control along with GitHub to track changes to files, collaborate with others, display code publicly for others to read/use, and revert to old version of a codebase. These technologies are used widely in industry as they allow for safe collaboration on software projects with multiple people.

## Milestone 2
- I created an image model on teachable machine for 4 different classes: Nothing, Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The model is a pretrained neural network with the images I provided becoming the last layer of the network.
